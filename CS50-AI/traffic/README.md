# CS50 AI Traffic Problem Set

When constructing the neural network, and experimenting to find a model that was both accurate and efficent I noticed several things. First, more complexity does not necessarily mean more accurate. Initially I thought the more layers I added to the network, the more accurate it would be, however adding more layers would sometimes even lower the accuracy when the model was trained. I learned that the nature of the problem really needs to be considered to construct an accurate model. In this case, once I added a second convolutional/ max-pooling layer, the accuracy of my model greatly increased. This makes sense because by the nature of traffic sign images, each sign is distinguished by higher level features like shapes and colors that make the sign unique. Once I added the second convolutional/ max-pooling layer, followed by only a single dense hidden layer the accuracy of the model during training quickly surpassed 90% and upon final training with 10 epochs had an accuracy around 98%.
